# hello-world
My first repository

=====================

Hello everyone. My name is Neil, and I just recently started learning how to code Java in college. I enjoy it quite a lot,
and have been looking for other oppurtunities to expand my coding abilities. I also enjoy performing magic,
walks on the beach, and contemplating life, the universe, and everything (Hint: the answer is 42).
